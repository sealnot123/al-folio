Hi! My nickname is Nott. I was an [Intl' Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6970) participant back in 2019.
I later received Thai government's Olympiad scholarship and came to study in *St. Stephen's Episcopal School* in 2019 as a HS senior, before I came to *University of Wisconsin-Madison* as a double-major CS-DS undergrad.
I love solving algorithmic/math/probability puzzles and brainteasers. I speak Thai and English. I am also learning Japanese.
